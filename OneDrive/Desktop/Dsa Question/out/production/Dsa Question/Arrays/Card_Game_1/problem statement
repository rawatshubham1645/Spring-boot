Hint
----------------------------
In the first testcase if Ram begins with 6 Shyam plays 8 leaving with Ram with no card left hence Shaym wins.

In the second testcase If played optimally Ram wins the game.

In the third testcase Ram begins with 50 and Shyam has no card with number greater than 50 on it hence Ram wins the game.
